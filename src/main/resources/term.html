<h3 align="center">Terminology</h3>

The following is a list of terms used throughout this help system.  These apply to building applications using
the oaFramework, along with using OABuilder.
<ul>

<li>Model - defines a group of related entities that are used to store data and 
include validation and business logic.
</li>
<li>Object Graph - a collective group of objects from the model.</li>
<li>OA (Object Automation) - name used for automating object oriented programming.</li>
<li>OABuilder - name of visual development tool.</li>
<li>Link/Relationship - used to define the rules for how objects are related together.
    Types are One/Many : O2O, O2M, M2M.  
    A link can be recursive, which is a self reference.
    Other links are available to create merged links, calculated, heirarchy, grouped, and more.
    
    Additonal information can include cascade rules, how and where the data is created, other
    required references, etc.
</li>
<li>Meta-data - additional information that describes specific pieces of the program in enough detail
 that it can be used to automate functionality.</li>
<li>Reflection - a way for code to read and use meta-data to call methods dynamically.
<li>Observable - a type of design pattern where events can be sent to interested listeners when
a particular event happens.  This is a powerful feature, but at a cost.  OA has overcome this
cost so that any object or collection of objects can be made observable.</li>  
<li>Reflective Model - used to describe how the OA model uses reflection, meta-data and 
the observable behavior of the model objects to automate how objects work together, even
with when running on separate computers (distributed).
</li>
<li>Datasource - used to store and retreive data.  Most common is relational database, but also 
includes xml, json, webservice, binary, csv, text, legacy formats/interface, etc.
OA defines a base OADataSource class that allows applications to be datasource independent.

<li>DAO - data access objects. Used for application data that is stored in a database or other datasource.</li>
<li>OAObject - base class for all model objects, that are observable, and can serve as DAO. 
<li>Hub - OA's obserable collection class, similar in functionality to an ArrayList, with additonal features.</li>

<li>Messaging - used by programs to communicate.  OA has built in messaging that allows OAObject and Hubs to 
stay in-sync with other applications.  OA also includes a way to define distributed methods, so that one application
can call it, and have it executed on another system.  This is all treated as if is was a local method call.

<li>Auto Number -
used by object property so that it's value will automatically be assigned, usually a sequentially number.
If the property type is "GUID", then a global unique identifier will be created, based on a unique system
prefix. 
</li>
<li>JDBC - Java Database Connectivity, used to access any database from a Java program.</li>

<li>OBX - file extension for files saved by OABuilder, using an XML format.</li>
<li>Owner - an object relationship, where one is a continuation of the first.  For example, 
an OrderItem does not exist without an Order - the Order is the owner.
</li>
<li>Property - data element within an object that defines a specific type of data.</li>
<li>Property Path - An important concept in OA that is combined with reflection to be
able to define a reference from one object to another object/objects through a path of relationships.
<br>See <a htrf="prpertypath.html">property path</a>

</li>
<li>Recursive - an object "self" relationship, where each object can have many of the same type
of objects, and they can also have many of the same, etc. 
</li>
<li>Sequence property - an property that is used to keep the order within a list, 
when there is not a sortable property to use.  
For example, if a Department has many Employees, you can use a seq property to keep
the specific order to sort the employee list.
</li>
<li>Transient - used by object or property to signify that it should not be stored.</li>

<li>Context - the User or System accessing the model.</li>
<li>Visible - for permissions, this uses a property path to determine if an object, property, etc. is visible.</li>
<li>Enabled - for permissions, this uses a property path to determine if an object, property, etc. is enabled for changes.</li>
<li>Hierarchy relationship - allows a property to be defined through a hierarchy property path.  This allows high or low level
settings.</li>

</ul>
