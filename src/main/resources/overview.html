<h3 align="center">Overview<br></h3>
OABuilder is a visual development tool for designing software Models,
that includes code generators for creating source code for  
databases, Java data access objects, application server, client application (full UI) and web application.

<p>
By using OABuilder along with the OA libraries, applications can be created in a fraction of
the time that it usually takes for building software, with advanced features not found in most
development tools.
<p>
OA includes the functionality needed for building commercial software - 
including rich UI components, reporting components, advanced client/server and distributed real-time synchronization, 
data automation for zero admin datasource access, intergration with other systems, etc.   
<p>

<b>Model / View / Control (MVC)</b><br> 
MVC is a well known design pattern that encourages the separation of responsibility within an application.  
Along with other design patterns like Delegates and Controllers, applications can be organized in a way
 that makes them consistent, and easy to manage and grow.
<p>

<b>Observability - and the OA "<i>Reactive Model</i>"</b><br>
The power with OA is in the fact that it has a "<i>reactive model</i>", where the model objects are observable.
This is a unique feature to OA, that can be ported to any other computer language, to ultimately 
create language independent systems.  This type of model allows objects to work together, similar to a curcuit board.  
This is used in areas like UI binding, relational to object automation, distributed synchronization, etc.  

 
<p>
<b>The Model</b><br>
A Model is a representation of the data that is needed within a computer program.
With OABuilder, you define this data using as much detail as possible, which can then
be used for code generation and documentation.  
<p>

<b>What's in a Model</b>
A model is organized into Objects, where an each object has the following:
<ul>
<li>Object information</li>
<li>Properties to define the actual data elements</li>
<li>Property paths to define a reference from one object to another</li>
<li>Calculated Properties that are values based on using other data, and is auto-recalculated as needed.</li>
<li>Links between the objects, that defines how objects are associated together.</li>
<li>Methods are custom code to include in the object</li>
<li>Indexes define quick look up values for finding an object.</li>
<li>Processes that interact and manage the model information.</li>
<li>Object Query API that can work with any datasource/database</li>
<li>Filtering - to define what will be included</li>
<li>Merging - getting data using property path</li>
<li>Real time synchronization - in application and across servers</li> 
</ul>
The data contained is then used to "<i>know</i>" how the objects should be created, along with database structure, server, UI, web app, etc.

<p>

<b>Some history</b><br>
OABuilder started out in 1999 as a tool to help define object 
and database models and has evolved into a tool that documents 
and generates the core business components within an application.  
Through the years, we have expanded and automatated much of the application
development process, including the following:
<ul>
<li>database scripts for creating and updating numerous databases</li>
<li>Object to Relational Mapping and code generation, 
where the objects automatically work with the database.</li>
<li>Server applications, full UI desktop app, distributed, service oriented, Web, etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>
OABuilder allows you to print the model, save it as a Pdf or image, and save as XML.  The toolbar
and menu has options for creating new Objects, creating relationships between objects, 
etc.
<p>
The strength behind OABuilder is how it puts the applications together, and the functionality that
a projects requirements.  The OA library allows it to be a used for creating tools, frameworks and
reusable components.

<p>
OABuilder was created using these classes and framework.
The OA packages can be found under "OA Java Packages" on the www.viaoa.com website.
