<h3 align="center">Overview<br></h3>

OABuilder is used by Software Architects to design software for projects of all sizes, to use a "Model Driven Approach" to building software systems. 
The model is the "blueprint" and captures enough information to be able to 
write the software itself, using various code generation techniques.
<p>
The design process is interactive, where Software Architects  
are able to design and work directly with customers, users, developers, etc.  
<p>
Besides being a Software Modeling tool, OABuilder is a "<i>code generator for creating code generators</i>", which means that it can be used to create custom code generators for building
any type of application, process, standards, etc.

<p>
OABuilder includes code generators for building "Proof of Concepts" in a mater of minutes, which helps improve and accelerate the design and modeling process.

<p>
OABuilder is used for defining everything from the entity classes, entity relationships, searching, user interface, database, security & access, 
filters, processes, event handling, callbacks, reports, REST, openAPI and more.
This information is then used to drive the requirements and development process.

<b>The Model</b><br>
A Model is a representation of the details that are needed within a software application or platform.
These "details" are driven by software patterns based on object oriented programming, relational databases, rules engines, algorithms, and computer science techniques.
<p>
With OABuilder, Software Architects are able to capture as much detail as possible, which can then
be used for formal documentation and requirements, code generation, standards, testing, and more.  
<p>

<b>What's in a Model</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Model information that defines the project.</li>
<li>Object information</li>
<li>Links between the objects</li>
<li>Object Properties</li>
<li>Object Calculated Properties that are values based on using other data, formulas and algorithms.</li>
<li>Property paths to define a reference from one object to object objects.</li>
<li>Object Methods are custom code to include in the object</li>
<li>Callbacks that allow applications to interact with Objects at a fine grain level.</li> 
<li>Indexes define look up values.</li>
<li>Processes that interact and manage the model.</li>
<li>Object Query API that can work with any datasource</li>
<li>Filtering - to define what will be included</li>
<li>Merging - getting data using property path</li>
<li>Search information</li> 
<li>Information to define distributed deployments, using multiple services all acting as a single application</li> 
</ul>
