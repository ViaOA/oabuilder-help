<h3 align="center">Planning</h3>

At this stage you will be deciding the information that will
be used and how it will be organized and inter-related.
<p>
It's good at this point to use a white board, mind mapping, pencil and paper, etc. to start
creating draft documents and let the ideas flow.  This is where you determine
the "inputs", "outputs", objectives, rules, processes, etc.   
<P>
The next step is to determine the data that is needed.  
The data is then organized as if you were creating a data model for a database, where
data is organized into tables and columns.  
<p>
With object oriented programming (OOP), the modeling is more powerful, allowing to 
completely define the requirements and flow.
Data is organized into classes and properties, additional information, functionality, processes,
validation, event handling, so that the full business logic is included.  
This is captured in OABuilder while designing the model.

<h3>Our Sample Application</h3>
For our example, we will be creating an Application that allows company employees to earn 
points for completing assignments on time.  The points are then used to purchase various awards using a shopping cart approach.
