<h3 align="center">Code Generation Menu</h3>
OABuilder is also a code generation tool, with an <i>engine</i> that is designed to
create custom code generators.  
<p>

    This menu shows the code generation that is included in OABuilder. 
    We have also developed other generators and will be adding more in the future.
    <p>
    Note that these generators can be re-ran after an application has been created.  It does
    not use two-way generation, instead it uses templates and a way to include custom code into
    the model that is then added to (re)generated code.

<p>
<b>OAObject classes</b> - observable pojo "looking" entity classes, could also are DAO.  Each object
in the model will have a Java class created for it.
Also generated is classes for filters, and search objects.
<p>
<b>OAModel classes</b> - the model classes automate the wiring between the data objects, to 
form relationships like master/detail, linking, filtering, etc.
<p>
<b>OADataSource ORM</b> - automates the object to relational mapping so that the OA objects 
work with database.  Queries, save, delete, cascading, references, etc. are all part of the functionality
for OAObjects.
<p>
<b>SQL Script</b> - this will generate the DDL script used to create the database.
<p>
<b>SQL Changes Script</b> - OABuilder keeps track of all model changes and is able to generate a 
script that will then update the database.  
<p>
<b>Data Generator</b> - this will generate sample data to use for testing, etc.  We plan to have this be
more specific in future releases.
<p>
<b>JFC/Swing Application</b> - this will create a fully functional UI application using the Java Swing components 
that have been extended to be Object Aware/bindable.
<p>
<b>OATemplate files</b> - this will take the template project and use it as the base for the new application.
