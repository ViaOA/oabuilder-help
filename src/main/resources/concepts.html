<h3 align="center">Concepts</h3>

Software Architects use OABuilder for designing and building Software Models, where the Model captures the detail about a software application's data, relationships, rules, etc.  

<p>  
The model captures a large portion of the application logic and requirements, and is a common "cookie cutter" way of
designing and building software. 
Any remaining custom features can be included using various techniques, such as callbacks, common OOP techniques like subclassing, etc.
The end result is that a software application can be completely defined in the model.  This information can then be used to 
generate up to 100% of the application.

<p>
All software uses data that is specific to the function of the application.  
This is most common in database design.
OABuilder adds object oriented features to this, which allows the data to be treated as an Object Graph.  

This is a leap from data driven development, since it adds features including observablity, reactive, distributed communication, and more.
  
This combination of relational and object oriented techniques, results in a consistent and organized software development process.
<br> 
This data, sometimes referred as metadata, can then be used to define databases, model objects,
user interfaces, reports, web pages, web services, security, and any other part of a software system.

<p>
OABuidler uses a hierarchy structure for defining models.<br>
Each model has the following:
<ul>
<li>Classes - entities
<li>Links - references between classes
<li>Processes
<li>User Interface
<li>Permissions
<li>API
<li>DataSource
<li>Remote clients
</ul>
<p>

For each Class
<ul>
<li>Properties
<li>Calculated (formulas) Properties
<li>UI
<li>Indexes
<li>Filters
<li>Permissions
<li>References to other classes - direct, calculated, aggregated, grouping, merging and more.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Property Paths</b><br>
The model forms an <b></b>"Object Graph" of classes that are connected together by linking them together to form named relationships.
"Property Paths" can be used to define how to get from one class to another using the link names, and is used throughout the modeling process,
and in the generated software code.
