OABuilder is used by Software Architects for designing and building Software Models, where the Model captures the detail about the data, relationships, rules, etc.  

<p>  
A model created by OABuilder captures a large portion of the application logic and requirements, and is a common "cookie cutter" way of
building from model to model. 
The remaining custom features can be included using various techniques, such as callbacks, common OOP techniques like subclassing, etc.

<p>
All software uses data that is specific to the function of the application.  This follows 
industry defined patterns and is used throughout OABuilder, resulting in a consistent and organized software development process. 
This data, sometimes referred as metadata, can then be used to define databases, model objects,
user interfaces, reports, web pages, web services, security, and any other part of a software system.

<p>
OABuidler uses a hierarchy structure for defining models.<br>
Each model has the following:
<ul>
<li>Classes - entities
<li>Links - references between classes
<li>Processes
<li>User Interface
<li>Permissions
<li>API
<li>DataSource
<li>Remote clients
</ul>
<p>

For each Class
<ul>
<li>Properties
<li>Calculated Properties
<li>UI
<li>Indexes
<li>Filters
<li>Permissions
<li>References to other classes - direct, calculated, aggregated, and more.
</ul>
