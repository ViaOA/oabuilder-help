<h3 align="center">OABuilder Concepts</h3>

Here are various concepts about data models.
<p>
For creating software, you can think of it as using building blocks,
and organizing/configuring these blocks to work together.
These blocks come in different sizes, shapes and serve specific functionality, which
includes the ability to connect with other blocks.  
OABuilder allows you to visually build your data objects,
so that these "blocks" can seamlessly work with other blocks, and automate
how different blocks work together.
<p>
OABuilder is used for building Models, where the Model
is defined in enough detail that software can be generated from it.  This data,
sometimes referred as metadata, can then be used to create databases, data objects,
user interfaces, reports, web pages, web services, etc.
<p>
A Model represents Objects, and it's Properties that define the data contained in the
Object.  A Model also defines the relationships between the Objects, and how they
are inter-related.
<p>
All software uses data and this data is specific to the function of the application.
OABuilder allows you to visually model this data in a consistent way for any model.
