OABuilder is used for building Software Models, where the Model captures the detail about the data, relationships, rules, etc.  
This data, sometimes referred as metadata, can then be used to create databases, data objects,
user interfaces, reports, web pages, web services, security, and any other part of a software system. 
<p>
All software uses data that is specific to the function of the application.  This follows 
industry defined patterns and is used throughout OABuilder, resulting in a consistent and organized software development process. 
<p>  
This usually captures a large portion of the application, that is "cookie cutter" from model to model. 
OABuilder also includess various technigues for custom programming, by using callbacks, common OOP techniques, etc.
