<h3 align="center">Property Paths</h3>


Property Paths are used to create a path to a property based on how Objects are linked together.
Code can then use this to follow the path and return the value or values from it. 



<br>

Examples: "order.customer.name" will get the name for a customer, for a specific order.
<br>
"customer.orders:open().vendor.products" will get vendor products for a customer's open orders.
