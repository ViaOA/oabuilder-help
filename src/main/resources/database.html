Most applications use a relational database and keeping up with changes
to the application and the database can be a time consuming, monotonous,
and error prone job.  This is compounded further when an application is
deployed to multiple sites.
To make this easier and more manageable, OABuilder is able to fully define
and then generate programming code to automate this process.
<p>
Over the years, it has been more and more common for the database programming to be
seperated from the application programming.  There are huge benefits in doing this,
and there are various tools and frameworks for handling this.  OABuilder is set up
to be able to work with these and we are constantly researching to further expand
the code generation capabilities to work with all of these tools. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> OABuilder does not currently have a way for reading an existing database,
and then creating a OAModel from it.  This functiaonality will be included in
the next release.  To work with an existing database, you can create the objects to match
the database, or define the table/column names for the objects/properties to use.
<p>
This section will show the information needed to better understand and
work with database using OABUilder.
