<h3 align="center">Naming Conventions</h3>

<table width='100%'>
	<tr>
		<td>
The naming convention used by your database could be the same as the names
used in your OAModel.  If not, you are able to change this so that the mapping interface
will know the correct names to use.

<p>
For table name, go to the object in the <a href="editobject.html">Object Editor</a><br>
For column name, go to the <a href="">Property Editor</a><br>
<p>
For databases, it is common to name the the primary key for a table to be the table name 
plus the word "ID".  For your objects, you would want to name the property "id".  OABuilder
allows you to specify the database name for objects, properties, indexes, etc.  You
can also set the default naming conventions from the Model dialog window.
<p>
OABuilder does not visually display/list the properties for foreign Key columns.  Instead, this
information is store in the Link/Relationship, that is visually represented by
the line that links the objects together
