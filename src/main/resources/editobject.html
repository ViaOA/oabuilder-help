Super Class - from out experience, this is rarely used, but can be used so that the current object inherits from the select class.<p>

Name - class name to create, must be a valid Java name. Use camel-case for multipart names.
This will then update other settings to match.<p>

Display name - to show in UI, etc.<p>

Plural - name used for many of these objects.<p>

DB Name - table name.<p>

Pkey Name - name of DB table primary key.<p>

Display Property - this can be set to any property (or calc property) that is the default display for this class.<p>

Sort Property - name of property to sort by default.  It can also be a property that is flagged as a sequence property,
which will automatically be numbered in the order it was last sorted.<p>

Est Total - estimated total amount of objects that will be created.  This is for documentation only.<p>

Use DataSource - check if this should also exist in the database.<p>

Local Only - if true, then changes to this object will not be communicated to other servers.<p>

Add to Cache - if this is a local only object, then it can be choosen to be excluded from the OAObjectCache.<p>

Pre-Select - if true, then all objcts will be selected during program startup.<p>

Lookup - true if this object is used for a drop down type of selection.<p>

Server Root - if true then this the object will be selected from database and included in the ServerRoot as a reference.
The ServerRoot object is a top level object that will be sent to client applications during startup.

ClientRoot - similar to the ServerRoot, but this object is unique for each client that connects to the server.<p>
