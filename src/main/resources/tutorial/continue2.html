  <p>Next, let us go in fast forward and layout a few groups of the Objects needed: Employees, Awards, and Items. Then we will connect them together and start filling
    in details.
  <p>
    Here is the <i>story</i> - our customers are Companies, that have Locations, that have Employees. These Employees receive Awards, that can be redeemed for Items. The
    Items are in a Catalog, that is organized into Sections. Each Award has an AwardType, that is associated with the Catalog that can be used to choose an Item from. Each
    Item can have options (ex: color, size, etc).<p>
  
  <img sr c="images/demo/checkpoint.jpg">&nbsp;CheckPoint: you can use the saved Model from "checkpoints/2/EmpowHR.obx", that
    includes these new Objects.
  </p>

  <p>This is the design "mode" that you can be in when talking through the business requirements and building a model for it. The next "block" of changes will be for
    the shopping cart and creating and managing employee Orders. For now, we will zoom in and get this last block defined and tested.</p>
  <p>
    Color code the main Objects to green, to have them stand out, and have the other Objects unflagged so that they are gray.<br>

    Starting with Employee, we'll add the following properties.<br />

    The password will use a one-way encryption and needs to allow for some "bloat", so the size is set to 70.
  </p>
  <p>Create a link for "Location.employees" (one2many). This is not an owned link, since an Employee can be moved to another Location. We do want to make sure that
    Employees and the Location must be in the same Company. Otherwise, an Employee could be added to a Location in a different Company. To define this, go to the Link tab
    "General III" and set the equal property value for Location and Employee to be the common Company.
    
  
  <p>
  Location.Company &amp; Employee.Location.Company. This tells the Model that they both must match Company for it to be valid
