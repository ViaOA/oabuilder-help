  <h3>New Model</h3>

  <p>The code generator that we are using in OABuilder has a starter Model that we can use, "OATemplate". It has model classes for User and UI settings that we can use
    as our starting point.</p>
  <p>Qqqqqqqqqq show opening new model &ldquo;OATemple&rdquo; &hellip; make sure that it&rsquo;s in correct directory, and that it gets updated when changed</p>
  <p>
    We will open it and make a copy using menu option "File/Save Model As ...", naming it &ldquo;EmpowHR&rdquo;.<br /> <img src="images/demo/saveAs.jpg" alt="" width="895"
