  <h3>New Model</h3>

  <p>The code generator that we are using in OABuilder has a starter Model that we can use, "OATemplate". It has model classes for User and UI settings that we can use as our starting point.</p>
  <p>
    We will open it and make a copy using menu option "File/Save Model As ...", naming it "EmpowHR".<br>

    Next, use the Model Editor to configure this new project.<br> <img src="images/demo/modelSettings.jpg">
  </p>
  <p>
    <br /> Next create the directory name that was entered for "Code Gen Root Dir" above.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is now ready to be generated. This will allow us to run and see the application as we move through the demo. Click on menu item "Generators/Generate All"
    and select Ok. This will generate the project in the directory that you entered above. <br>
