  <h3>Add first Object</h3>

  <p>
    Let us add the main Objects, starting with Company. Click on the workspace toolbar "create new Object" (far left). This will create an empty object in the workspace. <br />

  </p>
  <p>Change the Object name to "Company", and the other fields will automatically be updated to match.</p>
  <p>
    Use the Object Editor to make the following change:<br /> <img src="images/demo/company1.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="330" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <br /> That is all we need for now, let us add some properties. The properties for "id" and "created" are already added by default. Note: the Id property is an auto
    assigned sequence number, and is the unique identifier - a good idea to use for most/all objects. <br /> To create properties, let us start off with "name". Click on
    the Properties editor and click on the new button.<br /> <img src="images/demo/newProp1.jpg" alt="" width="555" height="668" />
  </p>
  <p>
    and add abbrevName<br /> <img src="images/demo/newProp2.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="322" /><br /> Change the UI column title to "Abbrev".
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, now we have a Company Object, with properties. Let us update a couple of other things in the "User Interface" tab.<br /> Select name as the "Display Property".<br />

  </p>
  <p>While in the UI tab, go ahead and add the table columns for Company, and the Search properties.</p>
  <p>
    Table columns.<br /> <img src="images/demo/newObject3.jpg" alt="" width="878" height="480" />
  </p>
  <p>Search properties.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/demo/newObject4.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="330" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Company Object is now created with a few properties. We can now add to the Application's Main UI and test it.<br /> Adding to the Application UI is done by
    going to the Model Editor and choosing App UI tab.<br /> Add a new node for "Company" by clicking the new button and using the mouse to drag into position in the tree.
    Change the name to "Company". <br /> Click on the "Add ..." button and select Company from the popup. <br /> <img src="images/demo/newObject5.jpg" alt="" width="634"

  </p>
  <p>
    Note: always save your model changes. By default, all previous versions of the model will be stored in a backup subdirectory under the directory where you are saving
    your Model. <br /> example: ./backup/202105011310_EmpowHR.obx
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/demo/genrun.jpg" alt="" width="23" height="24" />ReGen &amp; Run:<br /> Click on menu item "Generators/Generate All" and regenerate the application,
    and rerun the Eclipse config for EmpowHr.
  </p>
  <p>
    This shows the Company search window.<br /> <img src="images/demo/singleUser4.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="380" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <br /> This shows the Company editor.<br /> <img src="images/demo/singleUser5.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="380" /><br /> &lt;![endif]&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
