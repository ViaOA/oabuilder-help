  <h3>Using Check Points</h3>
  
  
  Use CheckPoints for catching up with Model and sample data for this tutorial.
  <p>
    <img src="images/demo/checkpoint.jpg">CheckPoints: throughout this tutorial, there will be checkpoints with a number. This can be used to
    get a copy of the Model (EmpowHR.obx), and the data files "data.bin"  and "ObjectCache.bin".
  </p>
  <p>
    Go to the EmpowHR project at <a href="https://github.com/ViaOA/empowhr">https://github.com/ViaOA/empowhr</a>, and go to the checkpoints directory.<br>

    <p>
    From Eclipse:<br>
    
    <img src="images/demo/checkpoint1.jpg">
  
  <p>Do the following if you would like to use them at that pointer. Substitute # with the check point subdirectory that is needed.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Replace your model with EmpowHR.obx</li>
    <li>Copy ObjectCache.bin to runtime/server/data and runtime/single/data</li>
    <li>Copy data.bin to runtime/server/data and runtime/single/data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: some of the CheckPoints will only have a Model. You can use the previous checkpoint's data files.</p>

    instructions above to use the checkpoint files.
