  <h3>Discuss DataSource</h3>

  <p>
    <img src="images/demo/discuss.jpg"> Discuss &amp; Learn: Back to discussing databases ... the model objects are set up to work with any datasource, all types, and combinations. Currently, our demo application is using an in-memory datasource that supports sql/OQL and is persisted to xml, json,
    java binary. The client apps are using a client datasource, which remotely interacts with the server's datasource. Caching is included, and "hinting" is used when fetching data to make it more efficient when making a trip to another server or disk. For example, getting a Company is <em>smart</em> enough to know about other information that will be needed close to the Company (reference data, other Companies, etc), and sends this with the request as "hints". The hints are based on the
    object graph and how it is "wired" (used/configured) in the part of the application that is requesting data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>For example</strong>: a Company is using its LocationTypes to set the Company's Locations.locationTypes.<br /> If the Company X is not in memory (cache), then
    it will be requested from datasource. If it is running on a client, then the datasource knows the server(s) to get Company from. The computer could be using a database directly. Either way, it "looks" at how the Company will be used and can "hint" to "also send the Company.locationTypes, Company.locations, etc." if it has time.
    Otherwise, there is a good chance it might be calling for it soon, so go ahead and have it ready. This allows it to be dynamic and smart about how and what is being delivered and acts as a JIT (just in time) access for your model objects. The "goal" is to act as the objects are in the local cache.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Another example</strong>: selecting all Orders for an Employee, to display them and allow editing. The application code around this looks at how the model objects are "wired"/connected and will see that the OrderItems and other reference data could be needed (based on user navigation). When the method is called for order.getOrderItems(), it will look at another unloaded reference on "order", and along with the other Orders close to this Order from the collection of Order objects
    from the query.
