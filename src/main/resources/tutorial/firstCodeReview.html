  <h3>First Code Review</h3>


  <p>Take a moment to look at Code. The code generation uses a combination of techniques:</p>
  <p>1. template project, filling in using a small tag language. OABuilder defaults to using the OATemplate project.</p>
  <p>2. code generation, directly create files (source, resource, config, etc).</p>
  <p>3. Base classes that have subclass that can be used to overwrite methods.</p>
  <p>4. Report generation that uses html/xml engine to run as templates</p>
  <p>The code generation supports adding ""callbacks&rsquo; the generated model objects, propertys, links, etc.</p>
  <p>
    The project is generated using Model/View/Control structure, and directories that match. <br /> The Controller packages are responsible for managing specific
    functionality. <br>

  </p>
  <p>
    The Model package has the data/entity objects ("./model/oa/*.java"), and the "./model/*Model.java" classes are used to configure the object relationships and rules.<br />

  </p>
  <p>
    The View packages have the User Interface classes, each named after the Model Objects.<br>

  </p>
  <p>
    The Resource package has runtime parameters and default values.<br>

  </p>
  <p>For now, that is a good start for reviewing the source code - we will look more later.</p>
