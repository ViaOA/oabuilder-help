  <h3>REST API</h3>

  <p>
    There is full REST API included for the Model. For example, use your browser to go to "http://127.0.0.1:8080/servlet/oarest/companies" to see the list of Companies. <br />
    Use admin/admin for access. <br />

  </p>
  <p>
    <br /> We will spend more time on the REST API later, and the other web server features. It is a secure access to your full Model.
