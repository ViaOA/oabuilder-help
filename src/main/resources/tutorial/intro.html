  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    For our tutorial, we are going to design and create a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; (POC) software system for a fictitious company named "EmpowHR" (meaning "<em>empower
      Employee HR</em>").
  </p>
  <p>Here is a list of icons that we will use:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/demo/whiteboard.jpg">&nbsp;Whiteboard: capture ideas. <br /> 
    <img src="images/demo/rule.jpg">&nbsp;BizRule: mark business requirements (rules) for the application that we are building. <br> 
    <img src="images/demo/review.jpg">&nbsp;Review: used to recap what we just did before moving forward. <br> 
    <img src="images/demo/checkpoint.jpg">&nbsp;CheckPoint: allow you to get caught up with the latest Model changes and sample data from a github project. <br> 
    <img src="images/demo/genrun.jpg">&nbsp;ReGen &amp; Run: use OABuilder code generator to regenerate the application, and then run. <br> 
    <img src="images/demo/discuss.jpg">&nbsp;Discuss &amp; Learn: take time to explain some important concepts and technical details about how the system works. <br> 
    <img src="images/demo/continue.jpg">Continue working on the Model: after a discussion.<br> 
    <img src="images/demo/todo.jpg">&nbsp;To do item.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/demo/todo.jpg" alt="" width="24" height="25" />&nbsp;to do item: Show the screen shots of final App here.
  </p>
  <p>Along the way, we will give extra details on how to use OABuilder, generate the code, and run the application.</p>
  <p>This POC will allow the employees of our customers to earn points. The points are then used to purchase items from a list of choices specific to the type of award
    and the company offering the reward.</p>
  <p>The customers are companies that have hired EmpowHR to manage their employee award campaigns.</p>
  <p>The name of our platform will be "empowhr", and will need to be highly configurable, so that the customers are able to create a dynamic experience and tune it to
    match their company preferences.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to be able to build a single platform, that can run as a distributed platform. This means that we want our software to be able to scale and run
    hundreds of company campaigns, with over a million users, and expect an average of 500 users at a time, with spikes over 5k users.</p>
  <p>For our Proof of Concepts, we will deliver:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Object Model</li>
    <li>Class diagram for model.</li>
    <li>Database Scheme</li>
    <li>a working application with Desktop UI</li>
    <li>REST API</li>
    <li>Web Server</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Options to run as Server/Web Server/Clients/Single/CLI/Webservice/etc</li>
    <li>Various UI applications, based on type of user.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The production platform would look something like this. Locally, we will be able run as a single user instance, or as distributed as we want - clients/server,
    microservices, etc.</p>
