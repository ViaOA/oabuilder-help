  <h3>Test Client and Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
 
  <p>Next let us look at how to create a "Test Client", which is a client application that can connect and interact with the Server.</p>
  <p>We want to run the Server and have another program connect to it and select Employee John Doe.</p>
  <p>
    From Eclipse, go to "run configurations" and make a duplicate of your "EmpowHR client", then make the following changes.<br> 
    <img src="images/demo/eclipse1.jpg"><br>
    <p>
    If you run it now, it will try to connect to a server and fail, since the server is not running. Run the server,
    but first copy ObjectCache.bin &amp; data.bin from runtime/client/data to runtime/server/data. Then run the Server, and then run your testclient.
  </p>
  <p>
    The testclient connected to the Server and then exited. Now, pull up file TestClientController.java, and make the following change:<br> 
    <img src="images/demo/demo24.jpg"><br> 
    <p>
    Rerun and you will see console output showing the John Doe Employee object, and
    then it will disconnect after 2 seconds.
