  <h3>Web Server</h3>
  <p>
    While we have the server running, let us use the browser to see some features of the webserver. <br /> The server uses embedded Jetty for a zero admin webserver. It is configured as a high-end webserver with built-in services, including Java Server Pages, web services (SOAP), remoting through HTTP, REST API, Swagger/OpenAPI, security,
    and many more features.
  </p>
  See JettyController.java to check out how it is set up to run as an embedded server.

  The Application can also be run as a webserver only so that the application can be divided into "micro-services".
  Multiple instances can be run, and each instance will "know" how to connect to the server application.
  <p> 
  To do this, create another run type using the runtime/webserver directory and change the param to "webserver".

  <p>
  Run the Server first, and then start up a web server instance.
  <p>
  To start multiple instances of the web server on your computer, you'll need to start each one on a different port number.
  This can be done by creating more then one runtime/webserver directories (webserver1,2,3...) and edit the webserver.ini to change the port.
