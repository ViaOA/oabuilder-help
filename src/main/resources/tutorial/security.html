  <h3>Security</h3>

<p>
    OABuilder lets you define coarse and fine grain access and security - model, objects, links, properties, methods, etc.
    <p>  
    Let's go back to the Model UI and add a security setting to the "System" button, so that only
    Admin users can use it. &nbsp;The property Admin in User is used for this.

    We will show more on security as we move forward.
