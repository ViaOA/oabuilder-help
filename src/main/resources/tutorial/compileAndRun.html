  <h3>Compile &amp; Run as Java program</h3>

  <p>
    &nbsp;Create a new project in your Java IDE. Here, I am using Eclipse:<br /> <img src="images/demo/eclipseNewProject.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="719" /><br />
    Make sure to change Location to the directory that you entered for the Models code generator directory above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your project will look like this in the Eclipse project explorer.<br /> <img src="images/demo/eclipseAfterNewProject.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="370" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Set up the project to use Maven for building. Do this by right clicking on the project name, as follows ...<br /> <img src="images/demo/mavenConfig.jpg" alt=""
      width="806" height="837" />
  </p>
  <p>
    We are now ready to run. We have the option to run as a single user, and as a multi-user (client, client UI, server, web server, and more). <br /> The runtime directory in the project has subdirectories for each runtype to use as the "working directory".
  </p>
  <p>
    Running as a single user, do the following from Eclipse to set up to run as Single User mode:<br /> From Eclipse main menu, choose "Run/Run Configurations" and choose
    option to create a new launch configuration<br /> Enter the following:<br /> <img src="images/demo/eclipseRunAsSingle1.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="465" /><br />
    <img src="images/demo/eclipseRunAsSingle2.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="465" /><br /> This is now ready to run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Running the new App looks like this.<br /> <img src="images/demo/singleUser1.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="321" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on toolbar button &ldquo;Application&rdquo;.<br /> <img src="images/demo/singleUser2.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="321" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on menu item &ldquo;Help&rdquo;.<br /> <img src="images/demo/singleUser3.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="312" />
  </p>

  <p>
    <br /> This is the starting point, that will expand as we add and change the model.<br /> Quick note: this same application can be run as multiuser and split into multiple services at any time. For now, we will use the single-user runtime option.
  </p>
  <p>
    The runtime directory looks like this.<br /> <img src="images/demo/singleRuntimeDirectory.jpg" alt="" width="1156" height="480" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Runtime directory:<br /> The file single.ini is used for runtime config settings for single-user runtime mode. It has default settings for saving the data to file and loads it into an in-memory database at startup. We will switch over to a database later. For now, the in-memory DB does everything you need for queries and saving. The default config settings can be found in the source code, located in directory com/empowhr/resource, see files values.properties and Resource.java for the full listing and more info.<br /> <br /> <
