<h3 align="center">Workflow Overview</h3>

Creating applications with OABuilder is a reiterative process, that is a constant flow of 
building and improving.  It is a productive way to "grow" a project, modify it and rerun with no, or very little, programming.
 
<p>
Software Architects use OABuilder to directly work with customers and employees in a way that is "conversational", 
which allows the design to simply follow the requirements and rules for the software being created.
<p>
There are built-in code generators that allow for the software to be created and ran, as a proof of concept (prototype), and
 create an instant feed back loop.  This encourages a reiterative process of constantly improving and growing the project.
<p>
The result is that software complexity is reduced immensely, the scope of work that can be handled is very high,
and the requirements will match and be tested while in the design phase.

Creating a Model:
<ul>
<li>Create a new model</li>
<li>Define model settings, name, package name, location to generate data, etc.</li>
<li>Add new Objects (classes/entities)</li>
<li>Link objects together and define the relationships</li>
<li>Define object properties, that define the data elements of the objects.</li>
<li>Define calculated (formulas) properties</li>
<li>Define custom methods</li>
<li>Create filters</li>
<li>Define access and security</li>
<li>Define callbacks</li>
<li>Add custom code</li>
<li>Select and define datasource settings</li>
<li>Design UI, layout</li>
<li>Design reports</li>
<li>more</li>
</ul>

Testing and running the Model:
<ul>
<li>Print reports, PDF</li>
<li>Generate database scripts, which includes an update script for changes made that
affect an existing database</li>
<li>Save model, stores as an XML file, with obx file name extension.</li>
<li>Validate model.</li>
<li>Use code generators to generate POC, requirements, etc.</li>
<li>Generate database and project source code files.</li>
<li>Compile code.</li>
<li>Run as single user application, or as distributed across multiple servers/vms.</li> 
<li>Run as desktop, Web UI/browser, REST API, command line interface, etc.</li>
</ul>
