OABuilder can be used to create and update databases.  With databases, there are
tables, column, keys, indexes and more that an OAModel can create and update.
When changes to an OAModel are made, there are code generators that can then
create the database program (ex: sql scripts) to update the database to match
the OAModel.
<p>
Internally, OABuilder keeps a list of changes and from this is able to generate
the necessary changes need for the database to match the model.
<p>
Because all database have some differences in how they accomplish similar tasks, 
OABuilder has configuration settings that allow you to work with these differences.
<p>
OABuilder currently has code generators for relational databases that use SQL.  
Generators for other databases can be created by contacting ViaOA.
<p>
Mapping concepts - OABuilder is able to generate Object to Relationship Mapping (ORM) for 
various tools.  Use ORM, developers are able to work with objects that automate
most of the database programming, which allows developers to use an object oriented
approach to working with the program.  This also allows for a seperation between the
code and the database, allowing for support for other databases (database independent).
<p>
The following concepts are usual in understanding the differencs between
working with databases and object oriented programming (OOP):

Databases have Tables and Columns, OOP uses classes and properties.
Databases use primary keys to define uniqueness, OOP uses additional coding to allow for this.
Databases uses reference keys to link data together, OOP uses references.
Databases use link tables to manage many to many relationships, OOP does not need this.
Databases use SQL to select records, OOP can use an object query language based on the
object structure, that can then be converted to the database language.

<p>
Done correctly, applications can be built so that they are independent of the database.
Queries, updates, etc. can all be handled at an interface level so that the appropriate
database command is then used.
