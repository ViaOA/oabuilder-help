<p>
Models are the "blueprints" of software, that capture details that are used to automate software development. 

<p>
<b>Some history</b><br>
OABuilder started out in 1999 as a tool to define object 
and database models and has evolved into a tool that captures  
the details about a software application, so that it can be used by custom tools for managing and generating the software represented by the model. 
<p>
OABuilder, code generators, and the OA libraries have been used in numerous projects across many vertical markets.  This includes 
large projects with thousands of users and millions of transactions per day.    
<p>
OABuilder was created from expertise and experience from developing various software systems that include the following:
software modeling, MDA, RDBMS modeling, distributed architectures, code parsers, forward and reverse engineering, compilers, programming languages, and libraries.
