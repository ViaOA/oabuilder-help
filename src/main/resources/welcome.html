OABuilder is a software application for Software Architects, for designing and generating software applications.

Software Models are the "blueprints" of software, that capture details that are used to drive and automate software development.  The model 
not only describes what is required, but how it should be created.  This results in a consistent application development process, and allows 
for a reiterative "constantly improving" release process.<p>
OABuilder is first a software modeling tool, that makes it easy to design complex and sophisticated software systems.  
The techniques use relational and object oriented software patterns and principles, that capture the details necessary for software developers to be able to 
understand the requirements.
<p>
OABuilder also includes the ability to use the model to generate software applications, tools, requirements, and anything else from the model.
It uses a "generator for generators" approach, where the model data is able to be transformed and then used by various code generation techniques.   
<p>
Most importantly, modeling tools give Software Architects the ability to create software in a way that would be difficult 
to create otherwise.  It's a proven way to reduce software complexity and the problems that typically happen in software projects.  
 

<p>
<b>Some history</b><br>
OABuilder started out in 1999 as a tool to define object 
and database models and has evolved into a tool that captures  
the details about a software application, so that it can be used by custom tools for managing and generating the software represented by the model. 
<p>
OABuilder, code generators, and the OA libraries have been used in numerous projects across many vertical markets.  This includes 
large projects with thousands of users and millions of transactions per day.    
<p>
OABuilder was created from expertise and experience from developing various software systems that include the following:
software modeling, MDA, RDBMS modeling, distributed architectures, code parsers, forward and reverse engineering, compilers, programming languages, databases, and libraries.
